Part 1: Research & Selection
I found the following three promising forgery detection models that fit the criteria:

1. RawNet2 (Raw Waveforms for End-to-End Deep Learning)

Key Technical Innovation:

Uses an architecture based on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) + GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) to operate directly on raw audio.

Saves information by avoiding the need for manually created features (like MFCC(Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)).

Reported performance metrics:

Achieved Low Equal Error Rate (EER) (1.12%) and low tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) (0.033%) in Logical Access(LA) scenarios.

Why you find this approach promising for our specific needs:

Direct waveform processing (as opposed to feature extraction) offers real-time potential.

Works well for both unseen data and spoofing attacks.

Robust in the face of noisy real-world circumstances.

Potential limitations or challenges:

Needs a lot of training data in order to discover useful features.

For low-latency streaming situations, optimization might be required.

2. AASIST (Additive Attention-based Synchronous Spectro-Temporal Model)

Key Technical Innovation:

Uses synchronous feature fusion and additive attention to combine spectro-temporal features.

Learns both spatial and temporal patterns in spectrograms.

Reported performance metrics:

Achieved Low Equal Error Rate (EER) (0.83%) and low tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) (0.028%) in logical Access(LA) scenarios.

Why you find this approach promising for our specific needs:

Robust identification of AI-generated speech (e.g., VC(Voice Conversion), TTS(Text-to-Speech)).

Balances accuracy and interpretability..

With optimized inference, it could operate in almost real-time.

Potential limitations or challenges:

Higher computational load due to attention modules.

Needs GPU acceleration for real-time responsiveness.

3. End-to-End Dual-Branch Network

Key Technical Innovation:

This method enables thorough examination of the spectral and temporal aspects of audio signals by combining Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC) and Constant-Q Transform (CQT) features in a dual-branch network.

Reported performance metrics:

Achieved Low Equal Error Rate (EER) (0.80%) and low tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) (0.021%) in Logical Access(LA) scenarios.

Why you find this approach promising for our specific needs:

By combining LFCC and CQT features, the model is better able to identify subtle anomalies that point to deepfakes by capturing the subtleties of audio signals. It is appropriate for real-time detection in actual conversations because of its low EER, which indicates high accuracy.

Potential limitations or challenges:

Real-time processing capabilities may be impacted by the dual-branch architecture's potential to increase computational complexity. To strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy, optimization might be necessary.

Part 2: Implementation
Among the three selected models‚ÄîRawNet2, AASIST, and the End-to-End Dual-Branch Network‚ÄîI chose to implement AASIST due to its strong balance between performance, interpretability, and practical applicability.

Although RawNet2 simplifies the pipeline and operates directly on raw audio, it needs a lot of training data and may not be the best option for real-time use without additional optimization.

The Dual-Branch Network, on the other hand, combines LFCC and CQT features to achieve extremely low error rates, but it also adds more computational complexity, which may limit its real-time potential.

Using additive attention mechanisms, AASIST successfully combines spectro-temporal features, resulting in a low Equal Error Rate that is still easier to optimize for near real-time scenarios.

Part 3: Documentation & Analysis
1. Implementation Process

‚úÖ Steps Taken:

Cloned and set up the official AASIST GitHub repo
Installed all dependencies and modified the configuration to point to ASVspoof 5
Used the pre-trained model, replaced the final classification layer, and lightly fine-tuned on a small subset of ASVspoof 5
Recorded metrics (accuracy, loss) and monitored advancements over time
‚ùóChallenges Faced:

Large Dataset Management: ASVspoof 5 is huge; loading and preprocessing was time-consuming
Solution: Used a smaller balanced subset for testing
Inconsistencies in Audio Length: The durations of the various samples varied.
Solution: Padded or trimmed audio samples to a fixed length
Reproducibility: Minor inconsistencies due to randomness in data split
Solution: Set manual seeds across all libraries
üß† Assumptions Made:

AASIST architecture remains valid for ASVspoof 5 (even though it's originally designed for ASVspoof 2019)
Small-scale fine-tuning is representative enough for this task (for prototyping/demo purposes)
Real vs. fake is sufficient; didn‚Äôt distinguish between different attack types
2. Analysis

üîç Why This Model?

Top-tier performance (EER ~0.83%) among recent models

üîß Suggestions for Improvement:

Add data augmentation for noise/codec/channel variability

3. Reflection Questions

1. What were the most significant challenges in implementing this model?

The biggest challenges were dataset acquisition (slow download, large size), environment setup for a heavy model, and ensuring the protocol files align properly with the data loader.
2. How might this approach perform in real-world conditions vs. research datasets?

In real-world conditions (e.g., live phone calls), background noise, compression artifacts, and unseen spoofing methods may degrade performance. It might still be robust if fine-tuned with real conversational data.
3. What additional data or resources would improve performance?

Real conversational datasets with TTS/VC samples

Model checkpoint ensemble or multi-modal data (lip sync, prosody)
4. How would you approach deploying this model in a production environment?

Optimize model size using distillation or pruning

Batch process with fixed windows (e.g., 3‚Äì5s)
Integrate logging to track suspicious predictions and retrain periodically
